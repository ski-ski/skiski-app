## Description

SkiSki is a production class RESTFUL API that serves up data about resorts in the Lake Tahoe ski area. It provides routes that contain different resorts, their weather conditions, and their different trails. It also allows users to sign-up and make ratings about the resorts and trails, and have favorite trails that are ranked that they can see when they are signed in.
